Deadly Dinos: Park Tycoon!
I wish birds were real.
Why aren't carnivores nice?
If not friend, why friend shaped?
Some things have sharper teeth than others.
Carnotaurus is faster than it looks.
Pssh, we don't need electric fences.
If Rex was a little faster, it would be scarier than Acro!
Mahakala is the scariest dino. Stay away!
Therizinosaurus could take down Rex. Think about it.
Pooping, peeing, crying, sobbing, vomiting, screaming
Rex can still see you if you’re standing still. So just start hauling ass.
Spinosaurus lurks in the water. Don’t go swimming!
Is that a rock in the water? No, don’t jump on it. Trust me.
Watch out for the Golden Tree.
The fog is coming. The fog is coming. The fog is coming.
Don't look behind you.
There's something standing in your doorway.
Try Xaeros Minimap, so you can see the custom DDPT icons!

Deinocherius is just as aggressive as Therizinosaurus. Sorry...
Don't be a dino-sore loser... Click the respawn button!
